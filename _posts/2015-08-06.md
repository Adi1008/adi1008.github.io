Temperature is one of the most important variables in assessing an object's habitability. If an object is too hot, it may not have liquid water, and if it's too cold, then the chemical reactions needed to sustain life may not happen quickly enough on it.

The temperature of an object may vary with altitude, geographic location, or a number of other factors. Perfectly describing an object with a single temperature is impossible, especially when we don't have a lot of information about it. In this post, I explore how astronomers can estimate the temperature of an object by calculating its equilibrium temperature.

## Prerequisites

In order to understand the content in this post, you should have a *basic* understanding of the following topics:

- Energy, power, and flux
- Black bodies
- Inverse-square law
- Stefan-Boltzmann Law

If you want to brush up on these topics, I highly recommend reading Section 3.2 in *A Student's Guide to the Mathematics of Astronomy* by Daniel Fleisch and Julia Kregenow.

## Setup

Consider a star of radius $R_{s}$ and temperature $T_{s}$. An object (say, a planet) of radius $R_p$ orbits the star at a distance $D$. The planet has a Bond albedo[^1] $\alpha$.

## The Energy Balance

Blah blah blah

[^1] The Bond albedo is the fraction of incident light reflected by the planet. A planet that absorbs all light that hits it has a Bond albedo of 0, while one thta reflects all light has a Bond albedo of 1.
