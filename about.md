Hi! I'm Aditya, a first-year graduate student in the [Chemical Engineering department](https://cheme.stanford.edu/) at [Stanford University](https://www.stanford.edu/). I am broadly interested in the intersections of materials science and sustainability, particularly in energy storage and conversion.

I completed my undergraduate education at [UT Austin](https://utexas.edu), where I got a B.S. in Chemical Engineering and completed the Elements of Computing Certificate.
