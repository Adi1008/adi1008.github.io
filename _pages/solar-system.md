Solar System is a Division B event for the 2022 and 2023 seasons. For the 2023 season, it will focus on habitability within and beyond the Solar System. This event is meant to be highly interdisciplinary, drawing on concepts from astronomy, planetary science, geology, chemistry, and biology, among others.

## Resources

### Official Webinar

The A-Team typically produces a webinar to help students get a feel for the content and question styles that will be emphasized in their events, particularly at the national level. The Solar System webinar for the 2022-2023 competition season can be found below.

### Past exams

In my experience, working through well-written exams is one of the most effective ways to practice in Science Olympiad. Exams that I have written (or helped write) can be found [here](https://adi1008.github.io/scioly/past-exams). Additional exams can be found on the SciOly.org [Wiki](https://scioly.org/wiki/index.php?title=Solar_System) and [Test Exchange](https://scioly.org/wiki/index.php/2023_Test_Exchange).

### Websites

Websites serve as a great resource, whether you are a beginner or looking to deepen your understanding of a particular topic. The following websites are a good place to start.

- [Wikipedia](https://www.wikipedia.org/)
- [NASA Solar System Exploration](https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/)
- [NASA Astrobiology](https://astrobiology.nasa.gov/)
- [JPL Photojournal](https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/)

### Textbooks

Once you have a good grasp of the basics, you can start to delve into more advanced topics. In particular, *A Student’s Guide to the Mathematics of Astronomy* has some of the best material I have ever seen for solidifying your intuition for the underlying math and physics in this event.

- *Planetary Habitability* by Stephen R. Kane (2021)
- *Fundamental Planetary Science* by Jack J. Lissauer (2019)
- *Astrobiology: An Introduction* by Alan Longstaff (2015)
- *A Student’s Guide to the Mathematics of Astronomy* by Daniel Fleisch and Julia Kregenow (2013)
