Batteries have profoundly reshaped society, from enabling rechargeable portable electronic devices to accelerating decarbonization efforts. Working with experimental collaborators in the [Bao](https://baogroup.stanford.edu/) and [Cui](https://web.stanford.edu/group/cui_group/) groups at Stanford, I use simulation and theory to study the molecular-level phenomena governing battery electrolytes, both in the bulk and near the electrodes.

## Enabling fast redox kinetics through solvent asymmetry

## Correlated ion transport in high concentration electrolytes

## Formation mechanism and structure of ion aggregates

## Field theory of lithium charge transfer kinetics
