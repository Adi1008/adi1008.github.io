Hi! I'm Aditya, a first-year PhD student in the [Chemical Engineering department](https://cheme.stanford.edu/) at [Stanford University](https://www.stanford.edu/). I want to help build a more sustainable, equitable future by exploring intersections of materials science, renewable energy, and STEM education.

I completed my undergraduate education at [UT Austin](https://utexas.edu), where I got a BS in Chemical Engineering and completed the Elements of Computing Certificate.
