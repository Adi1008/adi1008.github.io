I'm a third-year Ph.D. candidate advised by [Prof. Jian Qin](https://web.stanford.edu/~jianq/) in the Chemical Engineering department at <span style="color: #8C1515;" title="Go Card!">Stanford University</span>. I completed my undergraduate education at <span style="color: #bf5700;" title="Hook 'Em!">UT Austin</span>, where I earned a B.S. in Chemical Engineering and completed the Elements of Computing Certificate. For more information, please see my [CV](/files/AdityaShah_CV.pdf).

My [research](/research) leverages simulations and theory to explore the molecular-level phenomena governing battery electrolytes. Specifically, I study the physics underlying ion transport, ion aggregation, and charge transfer in collaboration with great researchers in the [Bao](https://baogroup.stanford.edu/) and [Cui](https://web.stanford.edu/group/cui_group/) groups at Stanford. I am grateful to be supported by the [NSF GRFP](https://nsfgrfp.org/), [Stanford Graduate Fellowship](https://vpge.stanford.edu/fellowships-funding/sgf), and [Chevron Fellowship in Energy](https://solo.stanford.edu/opportunities/chevron-fellowship-energy-2025). 

Outside of research, I serve as a National Event Supervisor for the middle school space science events in [Science Olympiad](/scioly), where I help develop rules, [pedagogical resources](/scioly/solar-system), and [exams](/scioly/past-exams). I also enjoy doing [triathlons](https://www.stanfordtriathlon.com/), [reading](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/171170310-aditya-shah), and watching sports with my friends.
