Hi! I'm Aditya, a third-year PhD student advised by [Prof. Jian Qin](https://web.stanford.edu/~jianq/) in the Chemical Engineering department at <span style="color: #8C1515;" title="Go Card!">Stanford University</span>. I completed my undergraduate education at <span style="color: #bf5700;" title="Hook 'Em!">UT Austin</span>, where I earned a BS in Chemical Engineering and completed the Elements of Computing Certificate.

My [research](/research/) leverages simulations and theory to explore the molecular-level phenomena governing battery electrolytes. Specifically, I study the physics underlying ion transport, ion aggregation, and charge transfer. Overall, I hope to help build a more sustainable, equitable future by working at the intersection of physics, renewable energy, and STEM education.

Outside of research, I serve as a National Event Supervisor for the middle school space science events in [Science Olympiad](/scioly/), where I help develop rules, [pedagogical resources](/scioly/solar-system/), and [exams](/scioly/past-exams/). I also enjoy doing [triathlons](https://www.stanfordtriathlon.com/), [reading](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/171170310-aditya-shah), and watching sports with my friends.
