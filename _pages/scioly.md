[Science Olympiad](https://www.soinc.org/) is the nation's largest team-based science competition. Teams of students compete in events ranging from anatomy and astronomy to engineering challeneges.

I am part of the "A-Team", a group of Science Olympiad alumni led by [Donna Young](https://www.linkedin.com/in/donna-lee-young-35b3ba78/) and [Tad Komacek](https://www.physics.ox.ac.uk/our-people/komacek) that runs the astronomy-related events in Science Olympiad. We are generously supported by [NASA's Universe of Learning](https://www.universe-of-learning.org/) STEM outreach program.

Along with [Connor Todd](https://www.linkedin.com/in/connor-todd-548467171/), I serve as the National Event Supervisor for Solar System and Reach for the Stars. We make the rules, create educational resources, and run these events at the National Tournament every May. For the 2022-2023 competition season, the event is **Solar System**.

If you are interested in joining the A-Team, feel free to reach out to [me](mailto:adityashah108@gmail.com), [Connor](mailto:cwtodd@umich.edu), [Donna](mailto:dlyoung.nso@gmail.com), [Tad](mailto:tkomacek@umd.edu), or any other member of the A-Team you may know. We'd love to have you!
