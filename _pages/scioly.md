[Science Olympiad](https://www.soinc.org/) is the nation's largest team-based science competition. Teams of 15 students compete in 23 events covering everything from anatomy and astronomy to engineering challeneges, such as building a bridge out of balsa wood.

I am part of the "A-Team", a group of Science Olympiad alumni led by [Donna Young](https://www.linkedin.com/in/donna-lee-young-35b3ba78/) and [Tad Komacek](https://sites.google.com/umd.edu/tkomacek/) generously supported by [NASA's Universe of Learning](https://www.universe-of-learning.org/) that runs the astronomy-related events in Science Olympiad.

Along with [Connor Todd](https://www.linkedin.com/in/connor-todd-548467171/), I serve as the National Event Supervisor for Solar System and Reach for the Stars, the Division B space science events in Science Olympiad. Connor and I make the rules, create educational resources, and running these events at the National Tournament every May.

If you are interested in joining the A-Team, feel free to reach out to [me](mailto:adityashah108@gmail.com), [Connor](mailto:cwtodd@umich.edu), [Donna](mailto:dlyoung.nso@gmail.com), [Tad](mailto:tkomacek@umd.edu), or any other member of the A-Team you may know. We'd love to have you!
