I genuinely enjoy teaching for a number of reasons:

- teaching helps me understand the material better
- teaching forces me to explain concepts clearly and be concise
- teaching feels meaningful and fulfilling in a way that few other jobs do

During my time at Stanford, I have been a TA for CHEMENG 110B (undergraduate thermodynamics) and CHEMENG 340 (graduate statistical mechanics). In June 2024, I was fortunate enough to win the Chemical Engineering Department's Outstanding Teaching Assistant Award.
