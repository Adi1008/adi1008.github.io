I really enjoy teaching. It helps me understand the material better, and it forces me to be intentional about explaining concepts clearly and concisely. And above all, working with students and helping them grow feels meaningful and fulfilling in a way that few other jobs do.

During my time at Stanford, I have been a TA for CHEMENG 110B (undergraduate thermodynamics) and CHEMENG 340 (graduate statistical mechanics), where I wrote homework and exam questions and led office hours and discussion sections. These were immensely fun experiences, and I'm grateful to have been awarded the Chemical Engineering department's Outstanding Teaching Assistant Award for my efforts. If you're curious, you can read students' complete, unfiltered evalutations of my teaching for both [CHEMENG 110B](/files/course-evals/chemeng110b.pdf) and [CHEMENG 340](/files/course-evals/chemeng340.pdf).
