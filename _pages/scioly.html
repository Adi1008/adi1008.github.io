Science Olympiad is the largest team-based science competition in the United States. Teams of 15 students compete in 23 events covering everything from anatomy and astronomy to engineering challeneges, such as building a bridge out of balsa wood.

I am part of the "A-Team", a group of Science Olympiad alumni led by Donna Young and Tad Komacek that runs the astronomy-related events in Science Olympiad. Along with [Connor Todd](https://www.linkedin.com/in/connor-todd-548467171/), I serve as the National Event Supervisor for the Division B space science events in Science Olympiad. We are responsible for making the rules for the event, creating resources to help students with studying, and running the event at the National Tournament.

This year, the event is **Solar System**, with a focus on habitability. Occasionally, we also run the event at invitational or regional tournaments across the country. In addition to writing the exam for the 2023 National Tournament, I will be supervising Solar System at the UT Invitational and UT Regional this competition season in-person.

If you are interested in joining the A-Team, feel free to reach out to [me](mailto:adityashah108@gmail.com), [Connor](mailto:cwtodd@umich.edu), [Donna](mailto:dlyoung.nso@gmail.com), or [Tad](mailto:tkomacek@umd.edu). We'd love to have you!
